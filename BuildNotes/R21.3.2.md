## Bugs

  - Running at **Half Speed** latency mode causes frame sync issues across actors.
    - Solution is to run at Full Speed.
    - This may only be present when running machines at 60FPS.
  - High cpu times on Director when running at 60fps.
  -   This occurs even with just a video imput and causes frame drops.
